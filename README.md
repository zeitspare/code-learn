OOPS CONCEPT

### Class
 A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods

### Object
The object is an entity that has a functionality and property associated with it.

### Methods
A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes

### Functions
A function is a block of code to carry out a specific task, will contain its own scope and is called by name. 

### Inheritance 
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class.

### self
The word 'self' is used to represent the instance of a class. By using the "self" keyword we access the attributes and methods of the class in python.

### _ _ init _ _ method
"_ _ init _ _" is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.
